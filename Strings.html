    <!-- The divider for my palindrome container. I've created a container for the pally checker, mostly to make it easier to resize and color and whatnot in the css page. Containers tend to make things neater and tidier. -->

<!-- My image container with the source URL of the image and a description in case the image doesn't load properly. Again, the container mostly just helps me do stuff to the image a little easier on the css page-->
